## How Shiny Works (and why it's great)

<center>
  <img src = "shiny_method.jpg">
</center>

- Only have to write R code to create an app

    - Gets to a prototype quickly

    - Works great for solo developers
    
    - No need to learn a front-end language/framework

---

## Why do we need an alternative to Shiny?

- The same things that make Shiny great limit usefulness

    - Shiny is opinionated --> hard to customize look and functionality
    
    - R experience required, Shiny experience even more niche
    
    - Collaboration is limited
    
- Shiny is great for apps that:

    - Don't need significant customization (i.e., "take the defaults" approach is fine)
    
    - Are developed by a single analyst...
    
    - ...with R experience (Shiny experience preferred)

## maRio: an alternative framework

- Back-end: R

- Front-end: pick from anything!

## maRio: Benefits over Shiny

- Develop the font- and back-ends independently

    - Separate your team based on skillsets
    
    - Speed development
    
- Flexibility

    - Use whatever front-end you want
    
    - Redevelop the front- and back-ends independently for continuous improvement
    
    - Get beyond prototypes
    
    - <strong>Be creative!</strong>
    
- Provide an API with every app

    - With an independent back-end, you will be able to easily provide an API along with your app
    
    - App for standard users, API for other developers/analysts

## maRio: ...but what is it actually?

"Frameworks" are nebulous...here's where we might go with this:

1. R package with functions to:

    - &#10004; Setup project structure
    
    - &#10004; Run development servers for front- and back-end simultaneously
    
    - Create deployment scripts (docker files, nginx configurations, etc.)

2. Documentation explaining development and deployment options

3. Repository of example projects
